# Azure Function for Obtaining Shipment Rates and Persisting to Cosmos DB

This demo Azure Function App provides an API endpoint for fetching shipment rates for a given shipping address and package weight along with an endpoint for retrieving shipment details by id. The app is based on the v3 Node.js programming model and it utilizes [ShipEngine](https://www.shipengine.com/) for rate calculations. The obtained rates are then stored as a `shipment` resource in Cosmos DB.

The code structure is based on the Repository-Service pattern, and it leverages `InversifyJS` for Inversion of Control (IoC) and Dependency Injection (DI) to manage dependencies efficiently.
